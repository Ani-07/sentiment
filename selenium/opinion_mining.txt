elerianm	With time, this report will provide again important information -- and not on sectoral developments.  Over the next few months, It will help shed light on labor participation, the extent to which the unemployment surge will prove transitory, and how wages/hours worked will evolve	2020-05-08T11:12:24.000Z
elerianm	The consensus expectation of a 22 million job loss will set an historical record for this morning's US #jobs report.  Beyond this, information in the monthly report is either lagging realities on the ground, like the unemployment rate (consensus: 16%), or distorted (wage growth).	2020-05-08T11:08:47.000Z

elerianm	Also from  @markets , consensus expectations regarding Friday's monthly #jobs report for the US. Not so long ago--we're talking weeks here--this degree of job destruction would have been unthinkable.  Today, it's a lagging indicator given what weekly #jobless claims are telling us.	2020-05-06T17:46:41.000Z

elerianm	US government bond #markets are following equities in evolving the dominant "common global factor" from policy interventions to the phased re-opening of the #economy. With that, the yield on 10-year bonds has climbed over 0.70 bps (and the 2s-10s yield curve steepened to 52 bps).	2020-05-06T12:45:15.000Z

elerianm	On selling all of #BerkshireHathaway's holdings in four airlines at a loss,  @WarrenBuffett  notes that this wasn't motivated by management performance.

elerianm	The Fed's actions allowed riskier companies to borrow money at a rough time to stay alive.

elerianm	Thanks for the question. What wouldn't happen to the #Fed is large-scale balance sheet impairments or, like many developing countries, a direct erosion in policy effectiveness.

elerianm	As we internalize these horrid data from Europe, focus shifts to the US where we'll also get PMI and the much-watched weekly jobless claims. The context for the latter: Last week's 5 million jobless claims took the 4-week total to over 22 million, wiping 10-years of job creation.	2020-04-23T11:07:25.000Z
elerianm	GM While most economists agree that we're in a downturn deeper than the "Great Recession" that followed the Global Financial Crisis, consensus continues to lag the awful reality on the ground This was confirmed by today's worse-than-consensus (and new record low) PMI's for Europe	2020-04-23T11:01:37.000Z

elerianm	Interesting graphic from  @cnbc  highlighting the extent of US political polarization over when/how to reopen the economy.

elerianm	“Markets are still relatively optimistic,” says  @elerianm . “The other factor that’s still playing a large influence is the Fed … there’s a hope in there that we have a stronger Fed put. I don’t believe it, but that’s the hope out there.”	2020-04-22T12:05:56.000Z
elerianm	... and here are 2 snapshots of the carnage in the #oil complex. One captures the extent to which yesterday's meltdown in the May (expiring) contract contaminated the rest of the curve. The second shows both a casualty and a contributor to the oil price decline: The #USO oil #ETF	2020-04-21T20:25:27.000Z
elerianm	Understandably, US #markets found it hard to sidestep carnage in the #oil markets:  Major indices ended the session down 2.7-3.5% (#Dow below).  High yield #bonds also got hit hard. The (CDX--below) spread widened to over 681 bps, or some 150 bps wider than the #Fed-induced lows.	2020-04-21T20:12:23.000Z
elerianm	And just like that, #trading is halted for the "US Oil Fund,"the ETF meant to tracks the #oil market as it seeks to change the way in invests in order to reduce the risk of collapse This should also serve as a reminder of the vulnerability of certain #ETFs in less liquid #markets	2020-04-21T18:39:37.000Z
elerianm	Another reminder  of what happens when imbalances in the physical/financial #markets compound in a vicious manner: The June #oil contract has halved in price so far today. Expect the oil ETF fund to lose a lot of the flows it gained in recent weeks. #economy #investing #investors	2020-04-21T18:13:45.000Z
elerianm	Can you analytically reconcile the growing contrast between #stocks' bottom-up/top-down? Bottom-up: more companies suspend profit guidance citing pronounced lack of transparency Top-down: Many #WallStreet analysts are confident advocating end-year levels for the market as a whole	2020-04-21T14:44:18.000Z
elerianm	This makes sense and, I suspect, will continue to make sense. For this horrible journey of intense #covid19 #health worries and economic lock downs, as well as for the likely destination, corporate size will matter in many sectors (not all) and for many companies (again not all).	2020-04-21T13:55:29.000Z
elerianm	US stock #markets opened lower: #Dow down 2% and #NASDAQ continuing to out-perform.  #Trading is orderly, with notable name-specific differentiation by #investors.  Importantly, IMO, this highlights an important evolution in how markets are responding to a "common global factor."	2020-04-21T13:38:41.000Z
elerianm	Further to the last tweet,here’s a  @markets  chart that captures well what’s happening in the #oil complex away from the expiring front contract. The downward pressure is confirmed by the sharp drop in Brent which is down hard this morning. For implications, see last night’s tweet	2020-04-21T13:13:45.000Z
elerianm	While much of the media attention remains on the expiring #oil contract, the complex as a whole is under pressure again today price wise This is contributing to what Futures and Asian/European #markets suggest will be a risk-off open in US #stocks The 10-year yield is under 0.60%	2020-04-21T11:57:56.000Z

elerianm	“We may be at -10 to -14% growth for the U.S.,” predicts  @elerianm  on 2020 GDP growth. "This is a big hit. Even the benefits you would expect normally, lower oil prices means more dollars in consumers pockets, even that doesn’t work in this economy.”	2020-04-20T11:52:40.000Z

Disappointingly, the earlier massive #Fed policy intervention is yet to prove sufficient given rapidly-worsening fundamentals, delayed Congressional action and the damage already incurred	2020-03-23T14:17:12.000Z

elerianm	Pity those forced to put specific numbers on the short-term outlook for economic growth. As just reported by  @FerroTV  on  @BloombergTV , there's massive dispersion As discouraging as the numbers are, they signal analysts better internalizing the devastation of economic sudden stops	2020-03-23T13:34:07.000Z
elerianm	Last week the overwhelming sentiment among many was "what a year this week has been." US #markets are yet to open and already it feels like a week -- an historic one Having said that, am really glad i was at my desk at 2:30 am (CA time) and able to see the policy and market moves	2020-03-23T13:05:43.000Z

elerianm	A small positive re the global landscape for #stocks this early morning: It's not quite as awful as when #markets opened in Asia/Pacific but still bad. Australia/New Zealand ended down 5-7%; 3-5% lower for major Asian indices (Japan being the big exception); #Europe is down 3-4%.	2020-03-23T09:35:55.000Z

elerianm	Yes we're in the 2nd half of March but I fear that this is still too optimistic. Analysts are still having problems modeling how powerfully devastating economic sudden stops are ...and for understandable reasons. They've happened only in fragile/failed states, never at this level	2020-03-23T00:52:11.000Z
elerianm	US stock #futures are limit down (first chart).  For an indication of the severity of the pressure on #stocks, have a look at #markets #trading in #Australia (second chart) and #NewZealand. Both are down by around 8%.   #investing #investors #selloff #correction	2020-03-22T23:20:54.000Z
elerianm	Thanks! You know me well. Goal is to provide as much unbiased information/analysis as possible to help you all navigate highly unsettling/uncertain times. Please remember,collectively we have the ability to power through this awful period and prepare for the post-crisis landscape	2020-03-22T23:08:22.000Z
elerianm	For many, this will bring back memories of what happened to #markets when the initial vote on the large Congressional package first stalled in 2008 Absent a quick course correction, this will fuel the downward pressure on #stocks and other risk assets, oil, AND market functioning	2020-03-22T22:58:39.000Z
elerianm	Tide against #buybacks, in the immediate and probably longer, continues to grow.

elerianm	The new week's #trading in #financial #markets will start soon in Asia/Pacific and for US stocks futures.

elerianm	Re the effects on the real #economy of devastating sudden stops, some higher frequency indicators from the  @FT . As partial as these inevitably are, they provide a sense of what's happening in sector after sector. The priority now is now to contain the damage, including spillovers	2020-03-22T17:10:18.000Z
elerianm	#Congress/the  @realDonaldTrump  Administration are finalizing a sizable #CoronaVirus emergency package in a remarkably rapid/bipartisan manner (thank you).

elerianm	In  @economics  by  @RichMiller28  and #Pickert Despite my best efforts, it took too long for consensus to recognize the dynamics of sudden stops and their destructive powers; Some still minimize the recession risk.

elerianm	Great question. Speaks to the importance of supporting crisis management measures with timely information on effectiveness as well, critically, with a road map through the crisis and a willingness to course correct as needed.  Absent this, disruptive self-insurance will increase.	2020-03-20T16:27:41.000Z
elerianm	Per  @Reuters : "fast-forward" correction not limited to #stocks. We shouldn't be overly surprised: #Markets entered this shock conditioned by years of ample and predictable central bank liquidity. With that came a widespread under-appreciation of liquidity/credit/equity risks.	2020-03-20T16:23:10.000Z

elerianm	Dip of 10-year UST yield below 1.00% is consistent with market hopes that large forced selling is over (see prior tweet). Question: wave over or a just pause.
